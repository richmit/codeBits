# To get org to evaluate all code blocks on export, add the following to the Emacs header on the first line of this file:
#     org-export-babel-evaluate:t; org-confirm-babel-evaluate:nil
#
#

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:

I use this file as a template & cut-n-paste source for org-mode documents.  As such, it demonstrates most of the stuff I do with org-mode.

* Math

Here is some math \( 5+3^4 \).

Display inline preview of an expression at/near point with C-c C-x C-l
 - With C-u, clear images for fragments in current section.
 - With C-u C-y, clear images for fragments in buffer

Here is some display math \[ \sum 4 \]

 \[\begin{align*}
   \frac{dx}{dt} & = a(y-x)   \\
   \frac{dy}{dt} & = x(b-z)-y \\
   \frac{dz}{dt} & = xy-cz
 \end{align*}\]

* Markup

** Inline stuff

Some *bold* text.

Some /italics/ text.

Some _underlined_ text.

Some =verbatim= text.

Some ~code~ text.

Some +strike-through+ text.

** Structural stuff 

*** Special Paragraphs

Some centered stuff.  Text, graphics, whatever...
#+BEGIN_CENTER
HI HO \\
Centered
#+END_CENTER

Here we have a quote:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A human being is a part of a whole, called by us _universe_, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something
separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires
and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all
living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. -- Albert Einstein
#+END_QUOTE

We can also keep newlines intact in an indented paragraph:
 #+BEGIN_VERSE
Whales Weep Not!

They say the sea is cold, but the sea contains
the hottest blood of all, and the wildest, the most urgent.
...
 
   -- D.H. Lawrence
#+END_VERSE

We can have a "verbatim" section with an "EXAMPLE" block.
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Here is some text.
Note that
 everything is    just as typed.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Tables

**** With formatting & a formula

#+CAPTION: A formatted table
#+ATTR_HTML: :align center
|---------+-------+-------+-------|
|         |       | <r10> | <l10> |
| /       | <>    |       |       |
| col 1   | col 2 | col 3 | Col 4 |
|---------+-------+-------+-------|
| another | bit   |     1 | 1.00  |
| a       | b     |     2 | 4.00  |
|---------+-------+-------+-------|
#+TBLFM: @4$4..@>$4=$3*$3;%.2f

**** Tables used to hold data

We can use tables to hold data for other blocks to read in the document.  The
section [[Access a table in this document as a data.frame]] shows how to access
the table below from R.  Note some specifics for R:
   - We have no "top line" on the table -- otherwise the row of titles is not recognized!! 
   - Spaces in column titles are transformed into periods for =data.frame= column names.
   - Empty data cells will be =NA= in the =data.frame=
   - Non-numeric columns will be "characters" not "factors"

#+TBLNAME:a-table-name
| factor 1 | factor 2 | value 1 | value 2 |
|----------+----------+---------+---------|
| a        | z        |       1 |       5 |
| a        | x        |       2 |       6 |
| a        | y        |       3 |       7 |
| b        | x        |       4 |         |

*** Lists

Here is itemized list:

  - first
  - second
  - third

Here is enumerated list:

  1) First
  2) Second
  3) Third

A bit of both:

  1) First
  2) Second
     - first
     - second
     - third
  3) Third

** Todo/action items

*** TODO:NEW This is a todo
    :LOGBOOK:  
    - State "TODO:NEW"   from ""           [2016-05-29 Sun 12:48]
    :END:      

*** ACTION:DONE This is an action item -- work speak. ;)
     CLOSED: [2015-11-01 Sun 22:36] DEADLINE: <2015-11-01 Sun>
     :LOGBOOK:  
     - State "ACTION:DONE" from "ACTION:WORK" [2015-11-01 Sun 22:36]

* Images

** PDFs in LaTeX and Raster Image in HTML

In this Section you will see one image.  A PNG for HTML, and a PDF for LaTeX!

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<div class="figure">
 <p>
   <img src="example.png" alt="example.png" />
 </p>
</div>
#+END_EXPORT

# One liners can be included like this:
# @@html:<b>@@bold text@@html:</b>@@

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\includegraphics[width=4in]{example.pdf}
#+END_EXPORT

# One liners can be included like this:
# #+LATEX: 

** Links to images and converting PDFs to high quality raster images

Reminder: toggle inline preview of images with: C-c C-x C-v

Here we have a pretty graph (in a PNG file):

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 40% :align center
[[file:example.png][file:example.png]]

The above file was generated from a high quality PDF file: [[file:example.pdf][example.pdf]]. Note that the link in the previous sentence is a link in both HTML and LaTeX.

The conversion was done like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
convert -density 600 -resize 1024 -background white -flatten example.pdf example.png
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Including external code

** org-mode INCLUDE 

Some Ruby code is the file file:example.rb.  It's contents are listed below:

#+INCLUDE: "example.rb" src ruby

** Entire header

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatum :exports results :wrap "src ruby :eval never :tangle no"
~/core/codeBits/bin/src2header example.rb
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ruby :eval never :tangle no
#!/usr/bin/env -S ruby
# -*- Mode:ruby; Coding:us-ascii-unix; fill-column:158 -*-
